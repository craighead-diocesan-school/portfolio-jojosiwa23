  <h2>My Project</h2>
  <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was a punching machine. We approched the semester not knowing what we were doing, but we soon found out that it wasn't coding so I was happy. It was making a carnival game.
<p>Firstly we had to create a group Montana Mouse and I decided we would work very well together so we did that. A week later a new girl joined our group I think her name was zoe? We then scratched our heads and came up with a awoesome idea. A PUNCHING MACHINE. We didn't really know how to approach it so we just started putting something together. A sturdy structure made out if E-pro8 bars, with rotatiing gears on the top.
  <p> We actually didn't know what thast was yet but all goods I guess.
